# Chrome Extension Idea: Video Speed Controller

## Authors

## Problem Statement

When watching lecture recordings, it's common for students to want to speed up the recording during periods of silence or slow teaching. Some students have preferences on what speed they prefer to watch their lectures at asynchronously. For example, some may prefer to watch at 1x speed while others may prefer to watch at 2x speed. Without this accessibility, students are forced to watch through their lectures at 1x speed which may take up unnecessary time. This extension will resolve this issue by providing students with the flexibility of watching their lectures at any speed they like.

## Target Audience

The target audience will be primarily students who prefer watching their lectures at a non-1x speed.

## Description

This Chrome Extension allows users to control the playback speed of online videos, specifically catering to students who want to optimize their learning experience by adjusting the speed of lecture recordings.


## Selling Points

1. Customizable playback speed

5. Seamless integration into one's browser

## User Stories

1. As a student preparing for exams, I want to increase the playback speed of lecture recordings so that I can review the material more efficiently.
2. As a student with hearing impairments, I want the ability to slow down the playback speed of lecture recordings to ensure I catch every word and fully understand the content.
3. As a student who prefers to watch lectures at 2.5x speed, I want to be able to do so on any platform that my professor posts recordings on.
4. As a student, I want to speed up the playback of lectures during review sessions to quickly skim through familiar material and focus more on challenging topics.
5. As a student who struggles with this content, I want to slow down the playback of lectures so that I can thoroughly go through the material at my own pace.

## Notes

Some potential challenges could be making the extension work for all platforms of lecture recordings since each can be different. Some include Panopto, Canvas module videos, YouTube videos, etc.
